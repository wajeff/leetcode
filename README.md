# leetcode

This repository is meant to store all of my leetcode solutions. It serves to:

    - document learning progress for myself,
    - store similar reusable code blocks for the future
    - demonstrate to recruiters and employers my coding capability (or lack thereof at times haha)
    
The solutions are categorized into easy, medium and hard (to be added when
needed). Within each difficulty directory, there is also an incomplete folder
for solutions that will be created at a later date. Typically, the reason for
incomplete solutions is a lack of knowledge in said particular data structure or
algorithm.
